/*
You are given a pointer/ reference to the node which is to be deleted from the linked list of N nodes.
 The task is to delete the node. Pointer/ reference to head node is not given. 
Note: No head reference is given to you.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
value[] = {1,2}
node = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: After deleting 1 from the
linked list, we have remaining nodes
as 2.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
value[] = {10,20,4,30}
node = 40
Output: 10 4 30
Explanation: After deleting 20 from
the linked list, we have remaining
nodes as 10, 4 and 30.
Your Task:
You only need to complete the function deleteNode that takes reference to the node that needs to be deleted. 
The printing is done automatically by the driver code.

Expected Time Complexity : O(n)
Expected Auxilliary Space : O(n)

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 103

Solution

=========================
*/


// There are 2 approahes to solve this problem
// 1. You can do this by swapping the values.
// 2. This method is a lot more efficient and requires you to have a good control over pointers. 
//     What if, you change the reference of the node to be deleted to the node placed just next to it?
//     Do you need to do something other than that?  â€‹Something to prevent memory leak situations? 
// 2. Copy the data of next node to the current node. 
// Then, link the node after the next node to the current node. 
// This way, next node is removed but its data is saved in the current node.
