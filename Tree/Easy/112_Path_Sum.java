/**
 * Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the
 * tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the
 * path equals targetSum.
 * 
 * A leaf is a node with no children.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: There two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
 * (1 --> 2): The sum is 3.
 * (1 --> 3): The sum is 4.
 * There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * Input: root = [], targetSum = 0
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
 * -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
 * -1000 <= targetSum <= 1000
